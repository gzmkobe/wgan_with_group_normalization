# wgan_with_group_normalization

The objective of the project is to combine Group Normalization with WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty) to achieve better performance on image generation. 


## Background
Generative Adversarial Network, estimated generative models by using an adversarial process
WGAN further developed the model by introducing Wasserstein distance as a metric to optimize discriminator 
As the model still appears slow to converge and hard to train, improved WGAN-GP with a gradient penalty in loss to achieve better learning result
